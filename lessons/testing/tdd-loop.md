# The TDD Loop

Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop, built one vertical slice at a time. This is the tool-agnostic discipline; Vitest specifics live in [vitest.md](vitest.md), and what-to-mock in [mocking-and-fixtures.md](mocking-and-fixtures.md).

> _Lesson · testing. Consolidates `tdd/SKILL.md` + `tdd/refactoring.md` (+ the good/bad-test principles from `tdd/tests.md`). Upstream baseline: `.upstream/tdd/SKILL.md`._

## The bar

- **Test behaviour through public interfaces, not implementation.** Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a spec — "user can checkout with valid cart."
- **Vertical slices, not horizontal.** One test → one implementation → repeat. Never "write all the tests, then all the code."
- **One test at a time; only enough code to pass it.** Don't anticipate future tests.
- **Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.
- **The discipline is one slice per commit, not keystroke order.** Red-green-refactor is a tool — reach for it inside a slice when design is uncertain or behaviour is subtle and a failing test gives real signal; writing test and code together is fine otherwise.

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification — "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

Concrete good/bad examples are in [vitest.md](vitest.md); what may and may not be mocked is in [mocking-and-fixtures.md](mocking-and-fixtures.md).

## Anti-pattern: horizontal slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" — treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior
- You end up testing the _shape_ of things (data structures, function signatures) rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes — they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test → one implementation → repeat. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle. Because you just wrote the code, you know exactly what behavior matters and how to verify it.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

When exploring the codebase, read `CONTEXT.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Before writing any code:

- [ ] Confirm with user what interface changes are needed
- [ ] Confirm with user which behaviors to test (prioritize)
- [ ] Identify opportunities for [deep modules](../codebase-design/deep-modules.md) (small interface, deep implementation) and [design for testability](../codebase-design/deep-modules.md#designing-for-testability)
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- [ ] Get user approval on the plan

Ask: "What should the public interface look like? Which behaviors are most important to test?"

**You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user exactly which behaviors matter most. Focus testing effort on critical paths and complex logic, not every possible edge case.

Stub the planned behaviors as a visible backlog with `test.todo` so each becomes a vertical slice to implement (see [vitest.md](vitest.md#running-tests-in-the-loop)).

### 2. Tracer bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```
RED:   Write test for first behavior → run it → test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass → run it → test passes
```

This is your tracer bullet — it proves the path works end-to-end.

### 3. Incremental loop

For each remaining behavior:

```
RED:   Write next test → fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass → passes
```

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass the current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for refactor candidates:

- **Duplication** → extract function/class
- **Long methods** → break into private helpers (keep tests on the public interface)
- **Shallow modules** → combine or deepen (see [deep-modules.md](../codebase-design/deep-modules.md))
- **Feature envy** → move logic to where the data lives
- **Primitive obsession** → introduce value objects
- **Existing code** the new code reveals as problematic
- Apply SOLID principles where natural
- Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first, then refactor with confidence. Use watch mode and shuffled test order to keep the refactor safe — see [vitest.md](vitest.md#running-tests-in-the-loop).

## Checklist per cycle

```
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```
